title: It Started With An Idea
description: >-
  The foundation of IntutMI was laid over a cup of coffee between two friends
  who wanted to do something about the brands who miss out on lots of
  opportunities, either due to the lack of information, or the availability at a
  very high price.

  In the long, sleepless nights they came together to form a selected bouquet of
  services which will be all in-house, so that the brands can be served more
  efficiently.
