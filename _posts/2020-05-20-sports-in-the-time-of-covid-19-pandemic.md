As the sports fraternity came to a disruptive halt owing to the COVID - 19 pandemic, we’re witnessing the most significant disruption to the worldwide sporting calendar since World War II \!

Sports leagues and federations across the world addressed the novel corona virus outbreak by suspending seasons and canceling play. The outbreak, which as of May 20, 2020 has killed more than 325,000 people globally, has affected sporting events across the world. As the number of confirmed cases worldwide has surged past 4.9 million, all major sporting events have now either been cancelled or postponed. The most significant one being the Tokyo 2020 Olympics which was due to take place in Japan this summer.

However, the International Olympic Committee and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have postponed the event to next year, and is due to take place from July 23 to August 8, 2021. The global value of the sports industry was estimated to be $471 billion in 2018 – an increase of 45% since 2011 – and before Covid19 stopped play, the only trajectory seemed to be upwards.

Now, every part of the sporting value chain has been affected, from athletes, teams and leagues, to the media that broadcast and cover games. The industry is trying to capitalize on the spike in media consumption by finding new ways to engage consumers. In the absence of live games, this means deepening the pool of content available to fans.

Sports broadcasters such as ESPN and Fox Sports are showing classic games, archived content, documentaries, e-sports and niche competitions in a bid to keep consumers watching. Individual leagues are doing the same. The NFL is making every game since 2009 available for streaming on its direct-to-consumer channel Game Pass, a strategy which led to a 500-fold increase in daily sign-ups for the service.

Mark Tatum, Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer of the NBA described the league’s strategy to the World Economic Forum - “We’ve launched an NBA 2K competition \[an e-sports form of the game\] with players streaming from their homes. We’ve expedited production to bring forward the release of a Michael Jordan documentary. We’re hosting live quarantine parties on social media with current and former players, and we’re showing classic games every night – all things to continue to engage our fans during this time.”

The reliance of sports leagues on broadcasters and of broadcasters on advertising revenue is laid bare by this crisis. It underscores the imperative to explore more diverse income streams. These could include live monetization models, such as gamified viewership (e.g. live payments for digital items, new camera angles, fan commentary, statistical analysis) and gambling.

The absence of “real” sport presents an opportunity for virtual technologies to grow. Already, sports leagues across the world are using e-sports to maintain interest and a sense of competition during shutdowns. e-sports have grown massively in recent years and present a new way to engage fans and bring in revenue. Furthermore, immersive technologies could enable fans to experience games live, without having to be physically present – an idea that once may have been counter intuitive but now seems logical.

In these difficult times, the ability of sports to bring people together is missed more than ever. The industry itself may be in new territory, but with the right strategies can emerge from the crisis stronger and more popular than ever.
