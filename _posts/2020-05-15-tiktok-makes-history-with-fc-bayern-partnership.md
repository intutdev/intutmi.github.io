Just few days ahead of the start of Bundesliga, Bayern FC signed a new sponsorship agreement with social media platform TikTok earlier this week. For Douyin, known as TikTok outside China, becoming an official Bayern Munich sponsor is an excellent opportunity to increase their engagement with fans.

As per the statement given by Felix Loesner, head of social media at FC Bayern Munich, “We saw the power and creativity, and also that it’s something new. It’s something like the old Vine where you can have creative storytelling for a special young audience. This makes the app so interesting for us.”<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;![](/uploads/bayern.jpg){: width="1140" height="641"}![](/images/blog/bayern.jpg){: width="1140" height="641"}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; source: [bundesliga](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/bayern-munich-president-hainer-backs-zirkzee-dajaku-batista-meier-singh-breakthrough-9894){: target="_blank"}<br><br>An interesting observation here is that Bayern FC has active presence on TikTok, with half a million video views. In a nutshell, Bayern FC has a strong social media presence, reaching out to 80 million fans. Bayern football players Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller already have a strong presence on TikTok. Bayern FC has an excellent opportunity to cash in to their fame and popularity, which will only increase to its social media presence.

<br>It is obvious that The Bavarian giants want to target its fans in China. It started when the club opened its office in Shanghai in 2016. According to Ye Jueming, head of Douyin Sports, with this sponsorship, the company is aiming on to produce great content about the club and its players.

“In China, Bayern FC is considered as the most innovative football club in terms of communication. With this partnership, we’re taking a very crucial step. The majority of communication in China takes place on social media. Short videos are the new trend," said Rouven Kasper FC Bayern’s President for Asia "With Douyin, we can offer our fans unique content and have the chance to further increase our portfolio.

Although, as the news came out, fans of this German football club has not taken the news in the positive way.

Many fans have come out to express their disappointment with this collaboration. Fans hasve started to post on the internet that YouTube would have been a better choice, calling content of the TikTok as ‘not worthy’ of being called a Bayern FC sponsorship. Some fans are even embarrassed stating that every goal the Bayern FC makes will now be turned into a funny TikTok video.

Whatever maybe the case, its eminent that post this historical collaboration, TikTok’s already soaring popularity will gain a new high and will see a growth in many new members.
